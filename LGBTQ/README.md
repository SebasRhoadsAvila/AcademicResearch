# Emotional Health Among the LGBTQ+ Community in Mexico: A Mediation Analysis

#### Abstract

This study addresses sexual violence as an intermediary factor affecting the mental health of the LGBTQ+ community. Initially, it reviews literature focused on three main aspects: the mental health of LGBTQ+ individuals, the connection between sexual violence and mental health, and the incidence of sexual violence within the LGBTQ+ community. Subsequently, it employs the National Survey on Sexual and Gender Diversity (ENDISEG) to identify findings in Mexico that align with the literature reviewed. The study concludes with a mediation analysis, demonstrating that sexual violence acts as one of the mechanisms through which LGBTQ+ individuals experience a decline in mental health.

### Introduction

In the evolving discourse on mental health, the emotional well-being of the LGBTQ+ community garners significant attention due to its complexity and the distinct challenges faced by this demographic. This study attempts to dissect the intricate mediating factors between LGBTQ+ identity and emotional health. More precisely, by adopting a mediation analysis approach, this study reveals some layers of the process through which LGBTQ+ individuals suffer emotional problems, including depression, suicidal thoughts, and others.

Our study explores related literature and focuses on mental health and sexual violence among LGBTQ+ individuals compared with their non-LGBTQ counterparts and the propensity for victims of sexual violence to present symptoms of poorer mental health. Then, it uses the ENDISEG survey on the Mexican population, searching for similar conclusions to those found in different parts of the world.

Finally, this work concludes with Baron and Kenny’s mediation approach to show that the adverse mental health experiences among LGBTQ+ individuals can be significantly explained by their experiences of sexual violence, rather than solely by their LGBTQ+ identity.

### Literature Review

**Mental health among LGBTQ+ individuals**

Existing literature has documented a strong relationship between being part of the LGBTQ+ population and mental health outcomes, and between sexual abuse and mental health. There have been studies that prove LGBTQ+ individuals experience more health issues than non-LGBTQ+ people. These publications not only discuss medical conditions such as HIV, obesity, and cancer, but also extensively cover mental health issues like suicide ideation, depression, and anxiety, especially after being exposed to conversion therapy.

Historically, publicly identifying oneself as a non-heterosexual or non-cisgender person has been challenging. During the early stages of life, young people grapple with accepting their feelings and must decide (or guess) when and how to express themselves to friends, family members, and eventually, coworkers. As they mature, the primary concern shifts from family acceptance to dealing with institutional acceptance.

In the United States, LGBTQ+ students have been reported to have a higher likelihood of experiencing depressive symptoms and attempting suicide. In Canada, one study showed that most transgender people in their sample had seriously considered suicide in the past year. More general evidence about low emotional health associated with being part of the LGBTQ+ community can be found in countries such as Thailand, Chile, Europe, Australia, and China. A 2021 UNESCO report showed that half of LGBTQ+ students in Europe have suffered bullying based on their sexuality and 83% had witnessed negative comments based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expressions, or variations of sex characteristics.

**Sexual violence and mental health**

Regarding sexual abuse in general, this type of violence has a tremendous impact on the overall health of the people who suffer from it. Literature usually focuses on women as they are the primary victims. However, both females and males exhibit similar behavior after being sexually assaulted. They both report lower health status and are associated with suicide ideation, depression, and anxiety.

Being physically assaulted is usually associated with lower physical health, whereas sexual assault is associated with mental health issues. However, they both often come with emotional abuse, which affects the daily lives of victims and future behaviors. One study in Japan had victims reporting problems with performing usual activities, walking, concentrating, and memory. Female veterans who were sexually assaulted during their military service in the US, and many during their childhood, were most likely to report chronic health problems and use prescription medications for mental health problems. They were also less likely to have completed college. Risky sexual behaviors were also identified as consequences of sexual violence, including unprotected sex, sex under the influence of alcohol or other substances, and sex work.

**Sexual violence in the LGBTQ+ community**

Sexual abuse has profound implications for its victims, particularly those belonging to marginalized communities such as the LGBTQ+. Sexual violence can manifest physically through forced penetration and assault, as well as psychologically through verbal harassment, intimidation, and social pressure. The LGBTQ+ community, already struggling with societal prejudices and systemic discrimination, faces unique challenges when confronted with sexual abuse. A review of recent literature highlights the multifaceted effects of such abuse on LGBTQ+ individuals.

The 2017 National Crime Victimization Survey revealed that sexual and gender minorities in the United States face a significantly higher risk of violent crimes including rape, sexual assault, and aggravated assault, at rates 3 to 4 times greater than the general population. There is discussion about underreported sexual violence among young students due to distrust in support services, fear of embarrassment, and a belief that reporting would not lead to meaningful action.

In 2020, a national survey conducted in Australia among LGBTQ+ individuals revealed that nearly half of the respondents had experienced some form of sexual violence in their lifetime. Further investigations about the specific nature of such incidents led to a 2022 study in New South Wales, indicating a significant rate of LGBTQ+ participants who had encountered incidents such as groping, uncomfortable leering, receiving sexually offensive comments, and unwanted flirtatious behavior.

The overwhelming evidence from different parts of the world, especially the west, highlights the prevalence and severity of diverse forms of sexual violence against LGBTQ+ individuals.

### Related Literature

Given the evidence in the existing literature, one might wonder the extent to which being victims of sexual violence is one of the mediating forces behind the relationship between LGBTQ+ identification and mental health outcomes, which is the purpose of this study. As such, this paper relates to those that have attempted to identify these mediators.

One particular study worth considering utilized mediation analyses to demonstrate how discrimination accounted for higher emotional distress among young LGBTQ+ males and females in the US. This study employed symptoms of depression, self-harm, and suicidal ideation as indicators of emotional distress, which were highlighted as significantly more prevalent among our subjects of interest compared to heterosexuals. In addition, youth participants were asked, **"Sometimes people feel they are discriminated against or treated badly by others. In the past 12 months, have you felt discriminated against because someone thought you were gay, lesbian, or bisexual?"**. Those who answered **“yes”** exhibited significantly higher rates of self-harm and suicidal ideation compared to those who answered **"no"**, as well as higher levels of depressive symptomatology. However, the study could only establish that perceived discrimination strongly mediates the relationship between young LGBTQ+ males and depressive symptomatology.

### ENDISEG

This study uses data from The National Survey on Sexual and Gender Diversity (ENDISEG) 2021, which was developed by Mexico's National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI) to understand the characteristics related to sexuality, gender identity, and sexual orientation of the population aged 15 and older. Its aim is to identify individuals whose identity or orientation doesn't conform to hetero-patriarchal societal norms (LGBTQI+ community). The survey’s sample size is 44,189 participants who represent 97.2 million people in Mexico.

**Precedents**

In the 2000s, Mexico witnessed significant legislative advancements in support of sexual and gender diversity. On May 17, 2007, the country marked a monumental step by establishing it as the Day of the Fight Against Homophobia. Just three years later, in 2010, this day was recognized as the Day of Tolerance and Respect for Preferences, following proposals by international organizations such as the United Nations and the Pan American Health Organization. This recognition was further solidified in 2014 when May 17 was officially decreed as the National Day Against Homophobia.

Health law reforms were introduced in 2009, acknowledging the needs of transgender individuals. These reforms allowed for hormone treatments and psychotherapy for those undergoing gender transition. A pivotal moment occurred in 2015 when the Supreme Court of the Nation (SCJN) unequivocally declared that no individual could be denied rights based on their sexual orientation. In the same breath of progressive action, the Federal District Government proclaimed November 13 as the official day to celebrate and recognize Transgender Persons.

In 2016, same-sex marriage was approved, with the SCJN asserting that marriage should not be an institution limited only to heterosexual couples. Alongside this, the regions of CDMX and Coahuila permitted same-sex couples the right to adopt. Furthermore, after consistent efforts and resolutions from bodies like CONAPRED in 2011 and a landmark ruling by the Supreme Court in 2014, institutions such as IMSS and ISSSTE began to recognize same-sex partners as rightful beneficiaries. These changes collectively underscored Mexico's evolving stance towards a more inclusive and diverse society.

#### Implementation

In December 2019, INEGI conducted the field test for the National Survey on Sexual and Gender Diversity (ENDISEG) in collaboration with the National Council to Prevent Discrimination (CONAPRED). The objective was to test a questionnaire through direct interviews with selected individuals aged 15 and over from households, assessing its effectiveness and collecting insights for refining the survey methodology. This field test informed adjustments to the survey tool and confirmed various methodological aspects for the main 2021 ENDISEG survey. Given the sensitive nature of topics like gender identity and sexual orientation, ensuring confidentiality was paramount. As a solution, ENDISEG 2021 utilized audio interviews to gather sensitive information, ensuring privacy since even the interviewers couldn't identify the responses provided. These unique features position the ENDISEG 2021 as a pioneering survey conducted by a national statistical office.

### Data and Methods

The econometric model applied to this study consists of various linear regressions that link different forms of emotional problems with being a member of the LGBTQ+ community. Then, the model incorporates indicators of sexual violence as mediators. However, before doing the mediation analysis, it’s convenient to present some basic data and statistical descriptions, as well as every variable’s constitution.

**LGBTQ+**

The variable “𝐿𝐺𝐵𝑇𝑄 +𝑖” is constructed from ENDISEG data. Participants were not directly asked if they identify as part of the community. Instead, they were queried about their gender, sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity, enabling the authors to infer their belonging in the LGBTQ+ minority.

The information used to identify an LGBTQ+ person came from the following characteristics of the participant:
- A male person who had their first intimate or sexual encounter with a man.
- A female person who had their first intimate or sexual encounter with a woman.
- A person who had their first intimate or sexual encounter with someone whose sex is neither female nor male.
- A person of any sex who has had sexual relations with someone of the same sex, either in the past year or at any point in their lifetime.
- A person of any sex who has felt, or feels, attraction to someone of the same sex.
- A person of any sex whose sexual orientation is identified as "lesbian," "gay or homosexual," "bisexual," or any non-heterosexual orientation.
- A person who does not identify with the sex assigned to them at birth.

All participants who didn’t count with any of the above characteristics were labeled as non-LGBTQ+. The final sample consisted of 7,368 LGBTQ+ individuals and 36,821 non-LGBTQ+ individuals.

**Emotional discomfort**

The survey directly inquired about participants' emotional disturbances, focusing on their current state, particularly over the past 12 months leading up to the survey. Utilizing data from ENDISEG on emotional health, we identified five key indicators crucial for this study:
- Insomnia.
- Depression.
- Stress.
- Changes in appetite or weight, either loss or gain.
- Feelings of anguish, fear, or anxiety.
- Suicide ideation.

The first part of the results of this study examines the prevalence of the above health conditions and compares the responses from the LGBTQ+ population to those from cisgender heterosexual individuals. For instance, 35.29% of LGBTQ+ individuals reported experiencing depression in the past year, compared to 29.88% of non-LGBTQ+ participants who reported the same.

**Sexual violence**

ENDISEG includes a section on social rejection, which features four pertinent questions for this study due to their focus on violence directed at the victim. These questions have been utilized as indicators of sexual violence:
- People who were sexually threatened or attacked.
- People who were harassed by propositions for sexual relations in exchange for payment.
- People who were forced to have sex.
- People who were groped without consent.

The comparison between participants shows that LGBTQ+ minorities are more likely to be victims of sexual violence than their counterparts. Nevertheless, these indicators allow us to search for a link between mental health problems and sexual violence. Taking all the survey’s population, we can extract a subset of individuals who were victims of sexual violence, identified as those reporting experiences corresponding to the previously specified indicators. Then, we see the proportion of individuals, from that sample, who also had insomnia, stress, depression, changes in appetite or weight, feelings of anguish, fear or anxiety, and suicide ideation.

**Mediation analysis**

The data extracted lead us to hypothesize that one of the reasons LGBTQ+ individuals suffer from emotional health issues is due to experiencing sexual violence. The statistical model proposed utilizes sexual violence as an intermediary factor between the individual and emotional disturbances.

Mediation analysis is a technique used to examine the underlying mechanisms between an independent variable and a dependent variable via a third variable. In essence, X influences Y through M, meaning that being part of the LGBTQ+ community is associated with poorer emotional health through the experience of sexual violence. This method allows us to estimate an indirect effect that the independent variable has on the dependent variable through the mediator, as well as the direct effect that the independent variable has on the dependent one.

Following the Baron and Kenny’s approach, we first look for a significant relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable, 

$𝑌_𝑖 = 𝛽_0 + 𝛽_1𝑋_{𝑖} + 𝜀_𝑖$, and we expect $𝛽_1$ to be significant. 

Then, we see if the independent variable is associated with the mediator, 

$𝑀_𝑖 = 𝛼_0 + 𝛼_1𝑋_{𝑖} + 𝜖_𝑖$, and we expect $𝛼_1$ to be significant. 

Finally, we regress the dependent variable on both the independent variable and the mediator, 

$𝑌_𝑖 =  𝛿_0  +  𝛿_1 𝑋_{𝑖}  +  𝛿_2 𝑀_{𝑖} + 𝜔_𝑖$. With the final specifications, we expect $𝛿_2$ to be significant, and $𝛿_1$ to be smaller in absolute value than $𝛽_1$ as this would mean that the mediator explains some of the effect that the independent variable has on the dependent variable. 

Literature on mediation would denote $\beta_1$ as the direct effect and the difference of $𝛽_1$ and $𝛿_1$ as the indirect effect. The idea of $𝛽_1 − 𝛿_1$ is that the mediator is reducing the effect of the independent variable.

This study constructed six regression models to evaluate the likelihood of reporting each type of emotional discomfort, comparing LGBTQ+ individuals to their non-LGBTQ+ counterparts. Subsequently, each model was adjusted by introducing 4 control variables (mediation variables), to assess the extent to which the coefficient associated with being LGBTQ+ changes.

### Results

Based on the data analyzed in this study, we concur with existing literature on three key points: First, LGBTQ individuals are more likely to experience lower emotional health compared to their non-LGBTQ counterparts. Second, individuals within the LGBTQ community face sexual violence at higher rates than those outside of it. Third, there is a significant difference in levels of emotional distress between those who were victims of sexual violence and those who weren’t.

![Image](https://github.com/SebasRhoadsAvila/AcademicResearch/blob/main/LGBTQ/Results/Imagen2.png)

This graph presents a comparison of emotional health issues between LGBTQ individuals and Non-LGBTQ individuals across six indicators: Feelings of anguish, fear or anxiety; Changes in appetite or weight; Depression; Insomnia; Stress; and Suicide ideation.

Each pair of bars represents the proportion of each group reporting a specific emotional health problem. The red bars denote LGBTQ individuals, and the blue bars represent Non-LGBTQ individuals. The values on top of the bars indicate the
percentage of respondents within each group that have reported experiencing the respective emotional problem.

From the graph, it is apparent that a higher percentage of LGBTQ individuals report each type of emotional indicator compared to Non-LGBTQ participants. The error bars on each bar represent confidence intervals, which provide a range of values within which we can be confident the true value lies.

Overall, the graph indicates that emotional health problems are more commonly reported among LGBTQ individuals than Non-LGBTQ individuals across all the indicators presented.

![Image](https://github.com/SebasRhoadsAvila/AcademicResearch/blob/main/LGBTQ/Results/Imagen3.png)

The second graph focuses on the prevalence of different types of sexual violence among LGBTQ and Non-LGBTQ individuals. This bar chart compares the proportion of each group that has reported experiencing four distinct forms of sexual violence: Forced Sex, Groping, Attack/Threat, and Solicitation.

As before, red bars represent LGBTQ individuals, and blue bars represent Non-LGBTQ individuals. The percentages displayed above each bar indicate the
proportion of respondents from each group who have reported experiencing the respective form of sexual violence.

Confidence intervals suggest that, even accounting for potential sampling variability, the differences observed between the LGBTQ and Non-LGBTQ individuals are likely to be consistent with the broader population.

This graph provides a clear indication that LGBTQ individuals report a higher incidence of various forms of sexual violence compared to their Non-LGBTQ counterparts.

![Image](https://github.com/SebasRhoadsAvila/AcademicResearch/blob/main/LGBTQ/Results/Imagen4.png)

Finally, this third graph contrasts the emotional health of individuals who have been victims of sexual violence with those who have not, across the same range of emotional problems that were used on the first graph.

The graph utilizes orange bars to represent victims and green bars for non-victims, with each pair of bars corresponding to the following emotional health issues: Feelings of anguish, fear, or anxiety; Changes in appetite or weight; Depression; Insomnia; Stress; and Suicide ideation.

The percentages placed above each bar signify the proportion of respondents within each group who have experienced the respective emotional issues. The confidence intervals on each bar demonstrate the robustness of the data, reinforcing the significant differences in reported emotional health problems between victims and non-victims of sexual violence.

The data highlights the considerable mental health impact of sexual violence on victims, with marked disparities across all indicators of emotional health problems.

**Regression Analysis**

The following table presents the results from a series of linear probability models that examine the association between identifying as LGBTQ and reporting various types of emotional discomfort. The dependent variables for each of the six regressions correspond to different emotional health issues: Feelings of anguish, fear or anxiety; Changes in appetite or weight; Depression; Insomnia; Stress; and Suicide ideation.

![Image](https://github.com/SebasRhoadsAvila/AcademicResearch/blob/main/LGBTQ/Results/imagen5.png)

The coefficients for the variable “𝐿𝐺𝐵𝑇𝑄+𝑖” across the models provide the change in the probability of reporting each type of emotional discomfort, controlling for other factors in the model. The number in brackets indicates the coefficient’s standard error.
The constant term in each model represents the predicted probability of the emotional discomfort for non-LGBTQ individuals, assuming that all other variables in the model are set to zero.
The asterisks (***) on each coefficient indicate the statistical significance at 99% confidence, implying a strong association between identifying as LGBTQ and reporting the emotional discomfort in question. For instance, the coefficient of 0.030 suggests that identifying as LGBTQ is associated with a 3 percentage point increase in the probability of reporting insomnia.

**Mediated Relationship**

Upon incorporating specified control variables, each linear model yielded distinct outcomes, but they all shared the same story. The coefficient for the LGBTQ variable significantly decreased upon the introduction of sexual violence indicators. These indicators acted as mediators, reducing the LGBTQ coefficient by approximately 3 percentage points. Notably, the absolute value of the LGBTQ coefficient became smaller than that of the mediator’s coefficient.

The next table presents present linear models that relate the mediator with the independent variable. We are following the Baron and Kenny’s approach. So, we require a significant relationship between the “𝐿𝐺𝐵𝑇𝑄+” variable and each of the mediators.

![Image](https://github.com/SebasRhoadsAvila/AcademicResearch/blob/main/LGBTQ/Results/Imagen6.png)

What we showed in the next six tables, is how the LGBTQ coefficient changes when mediators are introduced. We start with a simple linear probability model where the independent variable “𝐿𝐺𝐵𝑇𝑄+” is associated with each type of emotional discomfort. The initial simple model appears on the far left of each table. We then observe how the coefficient changes when controlling for each mediator individually. Finally, we present a regression including all variables, “𝐿𝐺𝐵𝑇𝑄+𝑖” and mediators on the far right of each table. These results are important as they reflect the last step in Baron and Kenny’s approach, where different types of sexual violence experiences explain some of the impact that belonging to the LGBTQ community has on lower emotional health.

![Image](https://github.com/SebasRhoadsAvila/AcademicResearch/blob/main/LGBTQ/Results/Imagen7.png)

The first model (far left) in each following tables displays the same results as Table 1, which are consistent with Figure 2, where the comparison of emotional health between LGBTQ and non-LGBTQ participants can be seen. For example, according to Model 1 in Table 3, that the baseline predicted probability of reporting insomnia for a non-LGBTQ participant is 41.8%. The “𝐿𝐺𝐵𝑇𝑄+” coefficient marks the difference between both types of participants, which can also be observed significantly on the bar graph displayed as Figure 2.

When we control for mediators “𝑆𝑒𝑥𝑢𝑎𝑙 𝐴𝑡𝑡𝑎𝑐𝑘 𝑜𝑟 𝑇ℎ𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡”, “𝑆𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛” and “𝐺𝑟𝑜𝑝𝑖𝑛𝑔” in Table 3 (Models 2, 3 and 5), the difference between LGBTQ and non-LGBTQ becomes non-significant. This means that people who reported those 3 types of sexual violence are more likely to report insomnia, wether they belong to the LGBTQ community or not. However, Model 4 indicates that having been forced to have sex at least once in a lifetime is associated with a 1.4% increase in the likelihood of reporting insomnia for those within the LGBTQ+ community.

![Image](https://github.com/SebasRhoadsAvila/AcademicResearch/blob/main/LGBTQ/Results/Imagen8.png)

Model 1 in Table 4 shows that the predicted probability of reporting stress for LGBTQ+ individuals is 70.1%. That is a 7.7% percentage points increase over the baseline probability for non-LGBTQ individuals, which is 62.4%. Every single mediator explains a higher chance of reporting stress, but it doesn’t change the positive sign nor significance that the “𝐿𝐺𝐵𝑇𝑄+” coefficient has, meaning that even if we control for sexual violence indicators, people who belong to this minority will be more likely to self-report stress. The inclusion of these controls, however, does reduce the magnitude of the coefficient directly measuring identification. Once controls for sexual violence are included, identifying as LGBTQ increases the probability of reporting being stressed by 3.6 percentage points over non-LGBTQ individuals. The number is less than half the one observed in column 1.

![Image](https://github.com/SebasRhoadsAvila/AcademicResearch/blob/main/LGBTQ/Results/Imagen9.png)

Every model in Table 5 has different values than Table 4, but they share the same narrative; depression is more commonly reported among LGBTQ+ individuals. Upon incorporating the mediators of sexual violence, the analysis continues to show a significant difference in the likelihood of reporting depression between LGBTQ+ individuals and their non-LGBTQ+ counterparts, but much smaller in magnitude (close to one fifth once all controls are included).

Just like in Table 3, the results of Model 1 are consistent with Figure 2. For instance, in the bar graph we showed that 35.29% of LGBTQ+ individuals reported themselves to have depression, against 29.88% of non- LGBTQ+, 5.41 percentage points significantly different. Model 1 in Table 4 indicates the same difference in terms of predicted probability. In Tables 3-8 Model 1 will show the same relationship as Figure 2, but the direct relationship between LGBTQ+ identification and the outcome variable decreases in magnitude with the inclusion of each of the indicators of experienced sexual violence.

![Image](https://github.com/SebasRhoadsAvila/AcademicResearch/blob/main/LGBTQ/Results/Imagen10.png)

As explained before, every single mediator took away approximately 3 percentage points from the “𝐿𝐺𝐵𝑇𝑄+” coefficient, which places sexual violence as one of paths LGBTQ individuals experiences lesser mental health.

![Image](https://github.com/SebasRhoadsAvila/AcademicResearch/blob/main/LGBTQ/Results/Imagen11.png)

![Image](https://github.com/SebasRhoadsAvila/AcademicResearch/blob/main/LGBTQ/Results/Imagen12.png)

Figure 2 and Model 1 in Table 8 shows that LGBTQ+ participants are twice as likely to report suicidal thoughts compared to non-LGBTQ+ individuals. The mediation coefficients hit their lowest values in Table 8, but still have a higher absolute value than the “𝐿𝐺𝐵𝑇𝑄+” coefficient. This observation indicates that, among the six indicators of emotional discomfort analyzed, the relationship between being a part of the LGBTQ+ minority group and experiencing suicidal ideation is relatively stronger.

### Conclusion

At the beginning of this study, we discussed worldwide evidence suggesting that: first, LGBTQ individuals exhibit poorer emotional health; second, there exists a relationship between emotional health and experiences of sexual violence; and third, the LGBTQ community is more prone to suffering from sexual violence. The ENDISEG survey enabled us to delve into Mexico’s LGBTQ community, uncovering results that align with those from other global studies.

By examining the outcomes from Mexico, we hypothesized that sexual violence is a contributing factor to the emotional discomfort experienced by LGBTQ people, which inspired a mediation analysis. Utilizing Baron and Kenny’s approach, we discovered that various types of sexual violence reports successfully mediate the relationship between this minority group and their lower emotional health. This study highlights one pathway through which lesser mental health in not inherently due to individual’s LGBTQ status, but rather due to how society treats them because of their belonging to this community.
